# Spring-Boot-DB-Data-Migrate
Migrate DB data from mySQL to Oracle using Spring Boot

This project has Web service calls if the programmer needs to run the jobs manually AND a scheduled job that runs every 20 seconds.
So making changes to primary DB data gets reflected in the secondary db after the scheduled job completes. 


TODO : 
1. Add SQL files for DB creation and Data Population in Primary DB.
2. Add SQL files for DB creation in Secondary DB
